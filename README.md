## **🛠️ Local Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Navigate to your desired folder and clone the repository. Then, move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordantete/OddsHarvester.git
   cd OddsHarvester
   ```

2. **Quick Setup with uv**:

   Use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a lightweight package manager, to simplify the setup process. First, install `uv` with `pip`, then run the setup:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Manual Setup (Optional)**:

   If you prefer to set up manually, follow these steps:

   - **Create a virtual environment**: Use Python's `venv` module to create an isolated environment (or `virtualenv`) for the project. Activate it depending on your operating system:

     - `python3 -m venv .venv`

     - On Unix/MacOS:
       `source .venv/bin/activate`

     - On Windows:
       `.venv\Scripts\activate`

   - **Install dependencies with pip**: Use pip with the `--use-pep517` flag to install directly from the `pyproject.toml` file:
     `pip install . --use-pep517`.

   - **Or install dependencies with poetry**: If you prefer poetry for dependency management:
     `poetry install`

4. **Verify Installation**:

   Ensure all dependencies are installed and Playwright is set up by running the following command:

   ```bash
   uv run python src/main.py --help
   ```

By following these steps, you should have **OddsHarvester** set up and ready to use.

#### **📌 Important Notes:**

- If both `--leagues` and `--date` are provided, the scraper **will only consider the leagues**, meaning **all upcoming matches for those leagues will be scraped**, regardless of the `--date` argument.
- **If `--match_links` is provided, it overrides `--sport`, `--date`, and `--leagues`, and only the specified match links will be scraped.**
- **All match links must belong to the same sport** when using `--match_links`.
- **For best results, ensure the proxy's region matches the `BROWSER_LOCALE_TIMEZONE` and `BROWSER_TIMEZONE_ID` settings.**

#### **Example Usage:**

- **Retrieve upcoming football matches for January 1, 2025, and save results locally:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_upcoming --sport football --markets 1x2 --date 20250101 --headless`

- **Scrapes English Premier League matches with odds for 1x2 and Both Teams to Score (BTTS):**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_upcoming --sport football --leagues england-premier-league --markets 1x2,btts --storage local --headless`

- **Scrapes multiple leagues at once:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_upcoming --sport football --leagues england-premier-league,spain-laliga,italy-serie-a --markets 1x2,btts --storage local --headless`

- **Scrapes baseball matches using a rotating proxy setup:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_upcoming --sport baseball --date 20250227 --markets moneyline --proxies "http://proxy1.com:8080 user1 pass1" "http://proxy2.com:8080 user2 pass2" --headless`

- **Scrapes football matches in preview mode (average odds only, faster):**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_upcoming --sport football --date 20250101 --markets over_under_2_5 --preview_submarkets_only --headless`

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport football --leagues england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 --markets 1x2 --headless`

- **Retrieve historical odds for multiple leagues at once:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport football --leagues england-premier-league,spain-laliga,italy-serie-a --season 2022-2023 --markets 1x2 --headless`

- **Retrieve historical odds for the current season of Premier League:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport football --leagues england-premier-league --season current --markets 1x2 --headless`

- **Retrieve historical MLB 2022 season data:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport baseball --leagues usa-mlb --season 2022 --markets moneyline --headless`

- **Scrapes only 3 pages of historical odds data:**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport football --leagues england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 --markets 1x2 --max_pages 3 --headless`

- **Scrapes historical odds in preview mode (average odds only, faster):**

`uv run python src/main.py scrape_historic --sport football --leagues england-premier-league --season 2022-2023 --markets over_under_2_5 --preview_submarkets_only --headless`

#### **📌 Preview Mode**

The `--preview_submarkets_only` flag enables a faster scraping mode that extracts only average odds from visible submarkets without loading individual bookmaker details. This mode is useful for:

- **Quick exploration** of available submarkets and their average odds
- **Testing** data structure and format
- **Light monitoring** with reduced resource usage

**Preview Mode vs Full Mode:**

| Aspect           | Full Mode                   | Preview Mode                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Speed**        | Slower (interactive)        | Faster (passive)              |
| **Data**         | All submarkets + bookmakers | Visible submarkets + avg odds |
| **Bookmakers**   | Individual bookmaker odds   | Average odds only             |
| **Odds History** | Available                   | Not available                 |
| **Structure**    | By bookmaker                | By submarket (avg odds)       |

### **🐳 Running Inside a Docker Container**

OddsHarvester is compatible with Docker, allowing you to run the application seamlessly in a containerized environment.

**Steps to Run with Docker:**

1. **Ensure Docker is Installed**
   Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. Visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/) for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   Navigate to the project's root directory, where the `Dockerfile` is located. Build the Docker image using the appropriate Docker build command.
   Assign a name to the image, such as `odds-harvester`: `docker build -t odds-harvester:local --target local-dev .`

3. **Run the Container**
   Start a Docker container based on the built image. Map the necessary ports if required and specify any volumes to persist data. Pass any CLI arguments (e.g., `scrape_upcoming`) as part of the Docker run command:
   `docker run --rm odds-harvester:local python3 -m src.main scrape_upcoming --sport football --date 20250903 --markets 1x2 --storage local --file_path output.json --headless`

4. **Interactive Mode for Debugging**
   If you need to debug or run commands interactively: `docker run --rm -it odds-harvester:latest /bin/bash`

**Tips**:

- **Volume Mapping**: Use volume mapping to store logs or output data on the host machine.
- **Container Reusability**: Assign a unique container name to avoid conflicts when running multiple instances.

### **☁️ Cloud Deployment**

OddsHarvester can also be deployed on a cloud provider using the **Serverless Framework**, with a Docker image to ensure compatibility with AWS Lambda (Dockerfile will need to be tweaked if you want to deploy on a different cloud provider).

**Why Use a Docker Image?**

1. AWS Lambda's Deployment Size Limit:
   AWS Lambda has a hard limit of 50MB for direct deployment packages, which includes code, dependencies, and assets. Playwright and its browser dependencies far exceed this limit.

2. Playwright's Incompatibility with Lambda Layers:
   Playwright cannot be installed as an AWS Lambda layer because:
   • Its browser dependencies require system libraries that are unavailable in Lambda's standard runtime environment.
   • Packaging these libraries within Lambda layers would exceed the layer size limit.

3. Solution:
   Using a Docker image solves these limitations by bundling the entire runtime environment, including Playwright, its browsers, and all required libraries, into a single package. This ensures a consistent and compatible execution environment.

**Serverless Framework Setup:**

1. **Serverless Configuration**:
   The application includes a `serverless.yaml` file located at the root of the project. This file defines the deployment configuration for a serverless environment. Users can customize the configuration as needed, including:

   - **Provider**: Specify the cloud provider (e.g., AWS).
   - **Region**: Set the desired deployment region (e.g., `eu-west-3`).
   - **Resources**: Update the S3 bucket details or permissions as required.

2. **Docker Integration**:
   The app uses a Docker image (`playwright_python_arm64`) to ensure compatibility with the serverless architecture. The Dockerfile is already included in the project and configured in `serverless.yaml`.
   You'll need to build the image locally (see section above) and push the Docker image to ECR.

3. **Permissions**:
   By default, the app is configured with IAM roles to:

   - Upload (`PutObject`), retrieve (`GetObject`), and delete (`DeleteObject`) files from an S3 bucket.
     Update the `Resource` field in `serverless.yaml` with the ARN of your S3 bucket.

4. **Function Details**:
   - **Function Name**: `scanAndStoreOddsPortalDataV2`
   - **Memory Size**: 2048 MB
   - **Timeout**: 360 seconds
   - **Event Trigger**: Runs automatically every 2 hours (`rate(2 hours)`) via EventBridge.

**Customizing Your Configuration:**
To tailor the serverless deployment for your needs:

- Open the `serverless.yaml` file in the root directory.
- Update the relevant fields:
  - S3 bucket ARN in the IAM policy.
  - Scheduling rate for the EventBridge trigger.
  - Resource limits (e.g., memory size or timeout).

**Deploying to your prefered Cloud provider:**

1. Install the Serverless Framework:
   - Follow the installation guide at [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/).
2. Deploy the application:
   - Use the `sls deploy` command to deploy the app to your cloud provider.
3. Verify the deployment:
   - Confirm that the function is scheduled correctly and check logs or S3 outputs.
